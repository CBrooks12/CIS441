## CIS441

This is all the work I had done in CIS441. All the information about the projects and how to run the projects can be found here: https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis441/

The final project is a self exporation project that showed what I learned over the course of the term. I made a visualization of a satellite revolving around a planet with a fixed view at the horizon complete with stars and off distant planets to show traveling in 3d space graphically.
